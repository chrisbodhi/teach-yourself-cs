Programming project 2 is also due next week.  It consists of all the exercises in [Section 2.2.4 of the text](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/full-text/book/book-Z-H-15.html#%_sec_2.2.4).

You can’t actually draw anything until you finish the project! To begin, copy the file `~cs61a/lib/picture.scm` to your directory.

To draw pictures, once you’ve completed the exercises:

```scheme
> (cs)
> (ht)
> (===your-painter=== full-frame)
```

For example:

```scheme
> (wave full-frame)
> ((square-limit wave 3) full-frame)
```
