Pointers

- "Since the name of an array is a synonym for the location of the initial element, the assignment ~pa = &a[0]~ can also be written as ~pa = a;~"
  p. 99

- ~a[i] == *(a + i)~

- "Applying the operator ~&~ to both parts of this equivalence, it follows that ~&a[i]~ and ~a+i~ are also identical: ~a+i~ is the address of the ~i-th~ element beyond ~a~."
  p. 99

- A pointer is a variable, but an array name is not. Thus, ~pa++~ is legal, but ~a++~ is not.
